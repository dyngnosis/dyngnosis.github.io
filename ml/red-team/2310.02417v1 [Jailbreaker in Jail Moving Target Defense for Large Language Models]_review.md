**Title:** Jailbreaker in Jail: Moving Target Defense for Large Language Models
**Authors:** Bocheng Chen, Advait Paliwal, Qiben Yan
**Affiliation:** Michigan State University
**Publication Date:** October 3, 2023

Summary:
This paper introduces a Moving Target Defense (MTD) enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) system to address the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial attacks. The proposed system aims to balance being "helpful" and "harmless" by delivering non-toxic answers aligned with outputs from multiple model candidates, making them more robust against adversarial attacks.

Key Contributions:
- First integration of moving target defense strategy with commercial LLMs
- Development of a response selection model for both "helpful" and "harmless" outputs
- Extensive evaluation on 8 LLM models showing significant reduction in attack success rates and refusal rates

Problem Statement:
Current commercial LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, either failing to be "harmless" by presenting unethical answers or failing to be "helpful" by refusing to offer meaningful answers when faced with adversarial queries.

Methodology:
1. Obtain responses from 8 different well-known large language models for the same query
2. Design a response analysis model to exclude unsafe or refusal answers
3. Implement a randomized selection process for responses using MTD strategy
4. Evaluate 8 LLMs using adversarial queries from the LLM-attack dataset
5. Manually label model responses as refusals, information-rich, or malicious

Main Results:
- Reduction in attack success rate from 37.5% to 0%
- Decrease in response refusal rate from 50% to 0%
- Perfect performance with both "helpful" and "harmless" responses

Qualitative Analysis:
- The MTD-enhanced LLM system effectively balances the objectives of being "helpful" and "harmless"
- The approach demonstrates the potential of combining traditional security defense methodologies with advanced LLM models
- The system shows promise in enhancing user experience by providing coherent and contextually relevant responses

Limitations:
- Need for extended testing on other commercial models and adversarial examples
- Consideration of computational expenses for implementing the defense mechanism at scale
- Potential replication of generated results from diverse models during response selection

Conclusion and Future Work:
The paper presents a novel approach to addressing adversarial attacks on LLMs by integrating MTD with commercial LLMs. The system shows significant improvements in reducing attack success rates and refusal rates. Future work may involve expanding the evaluation to more models and adversarial examples, as well as optimizing the computational efficiency of the defense mechanism.
