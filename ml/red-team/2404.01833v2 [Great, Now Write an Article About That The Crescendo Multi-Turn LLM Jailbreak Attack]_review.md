**Title:** Great, Now Write an Article About That: The Crescendo Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak Attack
**Authors:** Mark Russinovich, Ahmed Salem, Ronen Eldan
**Affiliations:** Microsoft Azure
**Publication Date:** April 2, 2024

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of Crescendo, a novel multi-turn jailbreak attack on Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Development of Crescendomation, an automated tool for executing Crescendo attacks
- Evaluation of Crescendo's effectiveness across various state-of-the-art LLMs
- Demonstration of Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenge of overcoming safety alignments in LLMs, which are designed to prevent engagement in illegal or unethical tasks. The authors aim to demonstrate the vulnerability of current LLM safety measures to multi-turn jailbreak attacks.

Methodology:
1. Manual execution of Crescendo attacks on various LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Anthropic Chat, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3)
2. Development of Crescendomation for automated Crescendo attacks
3. Evaluation using self-assessment (Judge LLM), external APIs (Google Perspective, Microsoft Azure Content Filters), and manual review
4. Comparison with state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques using the AdvBench subset dataset
5. Testing on multimodal models for image generation tasks

Main Results:
1. Crescendo successfully jailbroke all evaluated models across the majority of tasks
2. Crescendomation outperformed other jailbreaking techniques by 29-61% on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro
3. Crescendo demonstrated effectiveness in jailbreaking multimodal models for image generation

Qualitative Analysis:
- Crescendo exploits the LLM's tendency to follow patterns and pay attention to recent text, gradually steering the model towards generating harmful content
- The attack's use of benign inputs makes it challenging to detect and defend against
- Crescendo's success highlights the limitations of current LLM alignment strategies and evaluation benchmarks

Limitations:
- Crescendo requires multi-turn interactions, potentially limiting its effectiveness on systems without history features
- The automated Crescendomation tool inherits limitations from the LLMs used for attack generation and evaluation

Conclusion and Future Work:
The authors conclude that Crescendo exposes significant vulnerabilities in current LLM safety measures. They propose using Crescendomation for benchmarking and aligning LLMs against multi-turn jailbreaks. Future work may focus on developing more robust defense mechanisms and improving LLM alignment strategies.

New Tool:
