Summary:
This paper explores the trade-off between jailbreakability and stealthiness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), presenting a novel algorithm for detecting non-stealthy jailbreak attacks and enhancing model robustness. The authors introduce a stealthiness-aware jailbreak attack using diffusion models and leverage Fano's inequality to explain the relationship between attack success rates and stealthiness scores.

Key Contributions:
1. A novel algorithm for detecting non-stealthy jailbreak attacks on VLMs
2. A stealthiness-aware jailbreak attack using diffusion models
3. Theoretical framework using Fano's inequality to explain the trade-off between jailbreakability and stealthiness
4. Experimental results on various VLMs, including open-source and commercial models

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the vulnerability of Vision-Language Models to jailbreak attacks and the need to understand the trade-off between attack success rates and stealthiness.

Methodology:
1. Developed an Intra-Entropy Gap Algorithm for detecting non-stealthy jailbreak attacks
2. Created a stealthiness-aware jailbreak attack pipeline using:
   - Keyword extraction
   - Typography design
   - Story generation
   - Diffusion model-based image synthesis
   - Entropy gap checker
3. Utilized Fano's inequality to establish a theoretical framework for the trade-off
4. Conducted experiments on LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, InstructBLIP, Gemini, and ChatGPT 4o

Main Results:
1. The proposed detection algorithm effectively distinguishes between natural and jailbreak images
2. The stealthiness-aware attack achieves comparable success rates to existing methods while being more difficult to detect
3. Experimental results show a trade-off between jailbreakability and stealthiness across different VLMs
4. The theoretical framework provides insights into the limitations of jailbreak attacks

Qualitative Analysis:
- The study reveals that typography plays a crucial role in jailbreaking VLMs, even when imperceptible to humans
- The authors suggest that VLMs may perceive typography differently than humans, raising questions about model interpretability and security

Limitations:
1. The evaluation of potential harm from VLM outputs is inherently incomplete due to their open-ended nature
2. The definition of stealthiness is based solely on the entropy gap, not considering other aspects like perceptual quality
3. The study focuses on proof-of-concept demonstrations rather than comprehensive evaluations

Conclusion and Future Work:
The paper concludes that there is a principled trade-off between jailbreakability and stealthiness in VLMs. The authors suggest future research directions, including:
1. Refining detection algorithms for more sophisticated attacks
2. Exploring the applicability of their approach to a broader range of AI systems
3. Investigating how VLMs perceive typography that is imperceptible to humans

1. Intra-Entropy Gap Algorithm for jailbreak detection
2. Stealthiness-aware jailbreak attack pipeline
3. Maximum Entropy Gap via Rotation Partitioning algorithm
