**Publication date:** May 26, 2024

Summary:
This paper introduces an Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) to evaluate and exploit vulnerabilities in commercial text-to-image (T2I) generation systems, focusing on copyright infringement risks. The study reveals that current T2I systems, including ChatGPT, are susceptible to generating copyrighted content when presented with carefully crafted prompts.

Key Contributions:
- Development of the VioT dataset for evaluating copyright violations in T2I models
- Creation of an Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) for generating high-risk prompts
- Empirical evaluation of commercial T2I systems' vulnerability to copyright infringement
- Exploration of potential defense strategies against the proposed attacks

Problem Statement:
The research addresses the lack of quantitative evaluation of copyright violations in commercial T2I systems and the need for effective methods to assess and mitigate these risks.

Methodology:
1. Construction of the VioT dataset containing five categories of copyrighted content
2. Development of APGP using LLM optimizers to generate high-risk prompts
3. Evaluation of commercial T2I systems (Midjourney, Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT) using naive and APGP-generated prompts
4. Human evaluation to assess copyright infringement in generated images
5. Exploration of defense strategies, including post-generation filtering and concept unlearning

Main Results:
1. Naive prompts:
   - Midjourney, Gemini, and Copilot: 11-17% block rate
   - ChatGPT: 84% block rate
2. APGP-generated prompts on ChatGPT:
   - 11.0% block rate
   - 76% of generated images considered copyright infringement by human evaluation
3. Automatic QA evaluation:
   - 50.84% of generated images likely commit copyright infringement

Qualitative Analysis:
- The study reveals significant vulnerabilities in commercial T2I systems, even those with strong safety measures like ChatGPT
- APGP demonstrates the potential for automated jailbreaking of T2I systems, raising concerns about the robustness of current safety mechanisms
- The effectiveness of APGP in bypassing copyright protections highlights the need for more advanced defense strategies in T2I systems

Limitations:
- Results may vary due to the randomness of commercial T2I systems and potential updates to their services
- The study focuses on technical aspects of copyright infringement and may not fully align with legal perspectives
- Human evaluation may not perfectly represent expert legal judgments on copyright infringement

Conclusion and Future Work:
The paper concludes that commercial T2I systems currently underestimate the risk of copyright infringement. The proposed APGP method effectively circumvents existing safeguards, demonstrating the need for stronger defense mechanisms. Future work should focus on developing more robust protection strategies for T2I systems and exploring the legal implications of these vulnerabilities.

Tools Introduced:
- Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP)
- VioT dataset for evaluating copyright violations in T2I models

## Tutorial and Enhancement Suggestions

# APGP: Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline Tutorial

## Project Overview

The Automated Prompt Generation Pipeline (APGP) is a framework designed to evaluate and exploit vulnerabilities in commercial text-to-image (T2I) generation systems, with a focus on copyright infringement risks. The project implements the methodology described in the research paper to generate high-risk prompts that can bypass safety measures in T2I systems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `baseline_defense.py`: Implements baseline defense mechanisms
- `copyright_attack.py`: Main script for executing the copyright attack
- `evaluate_originals.py`: Evaluates original prompts on T2I systems
- `automatic_evaluation.py`: Performs automatic evaluation of generated images
- `pipeline.py`: Core pipeline for prompt generation and evaluation
- `llm_optimizer.py`: LLM-based optimizer for prompt generation
- `inference.py`: Handles inference for various language models
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used throughout the project
- `argument.py`: Argument parsing for command-line interface
- `vision_transformer.py` and `dino_utils.py`: Implementation of vision transformer model
- `Dataset/`: Contains dataset files for image paths and keywords

## Key Components and Functionality

### 1. Prompt Generation Pipeline (`pipeline.py`)

The core of the APGP is implemented in `pipeline.py`. Key functions include:

- `seed_prompt()`: Generates initial seed prompts using vision-language models
- `prompt_copyright_attack()`: Executes the main copyright attack pipeline
- `evaluate_genai()`: Evaluates generated images against target images

This pipeline implements the iterative prompt optimization process described in the paper, using LLMs to generate and refine prompts that can bypass T2I system safeguards.

### 2. LLM Optimizer (`llm_optimizer.py`)

The LLM optimizer is responsible for generating and optimizing prompts. Key functions:

- `llm_optimizer()`: Main function for optimizing prompts using LLMs
- `baseline_prompt()`: Generates baseline prompts for different stages of the pipeline

This component implements the LLM-based optimization strategy discussed in the paper, which allows for prompt generation without requiring access to the T2I model's gradients.

### 3. Inference Module (`inference.py`)

Handles inference for various language models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaVA. The `inference_llm()` function is a unified interface for different model types.

### 4. Evaluation (`automatic_evaluation.py`)

Implements automatic evaluation of generated images using:
- Representation similarity with DINO ViT features
- Question-answering based evaluation using VLMs

This module corresponds to the automatic evaluation methods described in the paper's methodology section.

### 5. Vision Transformer (`vision_transformer.py`)

Implements the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture used for feature extraction in the evaluation process.

## Key Algorithms and Techniques

1. **Iterative Prompt Optimization**: The core algorithm iteratively generates and refines prompts using LLM-based optimization, as described in Section 3.2 of the paper.

2. **Multi-modal Evaluation**: Combines CLIP-based similarity scores and VLM-based question-answering for comprehensive evaluation of generated images (Section 3.3 of the paper).

3. **Vision-Language Model Integration**: Utilizes models like LLaVA and GPT-4 Vision for image understanding and prompt generation.

4. **DINO ViT Feature Extraction**: Uses self-supervised vision transformer features for image similarity computation in the evaluation process.
