**Title:** How Alignment and Jailbreak Work: Explain LLM Safety through Intermediate Hidden States
**Authors:** Zhenhong Zhou, Haiyang Yu, Xinghua Zhang, Rongwu Xu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li
**Affiliations:** Alibaba Group, Tsinghua University
**Publication Date:** June 13, 2024

Summary:
This paper investigates the mechanisms of alignment and jailbreak in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing intermediate hidden states. The authors use weak classifiers to explain LLM safety and demonstrate that ethical concepts are learned during pre-training rather than alignment. They show how alignment associates early ethical concepts with emotional guesses in middle layers, which are then refined into rejection tokens for safe outputs. The study also explains how jailbreak techniques disrupt this process.

Key Contributions:
1. Demonstration that LLMs learn ethical concepts during pre-training, not alignment
2. Explanation of how alignment works through association of early concepts with emotional guesses
3. Analysis of jailbreak techniques and their impact on the alignment process
4. Introduction of the Weak-to-Strong Explanation method for interpreting LLM behavior
5. Proposal of Logit Grafting to approximate jailbreak effects

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the challenge of understanding how LLM safety mechanisms work, particularly the processes of alignment and jailbreak, given the black-box nature of large language models.

Methodology:
1. Weak-to-Strong Explanation: Use weak classifiers (SVM and MLP) to analyze intermediate hidden states of LLMs
2. Experiments on models from 7B to 70B parameters across various model families
3. Analysis of normal and malicious input datasets
4. Visualization of intermediate hidden states using Logit Lens technique
5. Introduction of Top-K Intermediate Consistency metric
6. Logit Grafting technique to approximate jailbreak effects

Main Results:
1. LLMs can distinguish between malicious and normal inputs in early layers with high accuracy (>95%)
2. Alignment associates early ethical concepts with emotional guesses in middle layers
3. Jailbreak techniques disrupt the association between early ethical classification and negative emotions
4. Models with higher consistency in associating negative emotions to malicious inputs are generally more harmless
5. Logit Grafting successfully approximates jailbreak effects, confirming the disruption of the association process

Qualitative Analysis:
- The study provides a novel perspective on LLM safety by examining the internal processes of alignment and jailbreak
- The findings suggest that improving the association between early ethical concepts and negative emotions could enhance LLM safety
- The research offers a more transparent understanding of LLM behavior, which could lead to more effective safety measures

Limitations:
1. The study focuses primarily on English language models and may not generalize to all languages or cultures
2. The analysis is limited to specific model families and sizes, and results may vary for other architectures
3. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques may depend on the specific implementation and training of individual models

Conclusion and Future Work:
The paper concludes that LLM safety is a collaborative effort between pre-training and alignment, with pre-training establishing ethical concepts and alignment associating these concepts with appropriate responses. Future work could focus on developing more robust alignment techniques based on these findings and exploring ways to prevent jailbreak attacks by strengthening the association process.

## Tutorial and Enhancement Suggestions

# Tutorial: LLM-IHS-Explanation

## 1. Project Overview

The LLM-IHS-Explanation project aims to analyze and explain the safety mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) by examining their intermediate hidden states. The project implements the Weak-to-Strong Explanation (WSE) method and Logit Grafting technique described in the research paper.

### Project Structure

- `visualization.py`: Contains functions for visualizing results
- `w2s_utils.py`: Utility functions for the WSE method
- `emotion_token.py`: Lists of emotion-related tokens
- `load_data.py`: Functions for loading and preprocessing data
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- `weak2strong.py`: Main implementation of the WSE method
- `load_model.py`: Functions for loading and running LLM models
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `resource/modeling_llama.py`: Modified LLaMA model implementation

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 Weak-to-Strong Explanation (WSE) Method

The WSE method is implemented in `weak2strong.py`. It uses weak classifiers (SVM and MLP) to analyze the intermediate hidden states of LLMs.

```python
class Weak2StrongClassifier:
    def __init__(self, return_report=True, return_visual=False):
        self.return_report = return_report
        self.return_visual = return_visual

    def svm(self, forward_info):
        # SVM classifier implementation

    def mlp(self, forward_info):
        # MLP classifier implementation
```

### 2.2 Data Loading and Preprocessing

The `load_data.py` file contains functions for loading and preprocessing the input data:

```python
def load_exp_data(shuffle_seed=None, use_conv=False, model_name=None):
    normal_inputs = get_data(norm_prompt_path, shuffle_seed)
    malicious_inputs = get_data(malicious_prompt_path, shuffle_seed)
    jailbreak_inputs = get_data(jailbreak_prompt_path, shuffle_seed)
    # ... (code for loading and processing data)
```

### 2.3 Model Loading and Execution

The `load_model.py` file provides functions for loading and running LLM models:

```python
def get_model(model_path):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_path, output_hidden_states=True, device_map="auto")
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
    return model, tokenizer

def step_forward(model, tokenizer, prompt, decoding=True, k_indices=5):
    # ... (code for running the model and extracting hidden states)
```

### 2.4 Visualization

The `visualization.py` file contains functions for visualizing the results:

```python
def topk_intermediate_confidence_heatmap(forward_info, topk=5, layer_nums=32, left=0, right=33, model_name="", dataset_size=100):
    # ... (code for generating heatmap visualization)

def accuracy_line(rep_dict, model_name):
    # ... (code for generating accuracy line plot)
```

## 3. Relation to Research Paper Concepts

The code implements several key concepts discussed in the research paper:

1. **Intermediate Hidden States Analysis**: The `step_forward` function in `load_model.py` extracts the intermediate hidden states from the LLM, which are then analyzed using the WSE method.

2. **Weak Classifiers**: The `Weak2StrongClassifier` class in `weak2strong.py` implements the SVM and MLP classifiers used to analyze the hidden states.

3. **Emotion Association**: The `emotion_token.py` file contains lists of emotion-related tokens, which are used to analyze how the model associates ethical concepts with emotions.

4. **Visualization**: The `visualization.py` file implements the heatmap and accuracy line plots described in the paper, helping to visualize the model's behavior across different layers.

## 4. Notable Algorithms and Techniques

### 4.1 Logit Grafting

The Logit Grafting technique is implemented in the modified `LlamaModel` class in `resource/modeling_llama.py`:

```python
class LlamaModel(LlamaPreTrainedModel):
    def forward(
        self,
        # ... (other parameters)
        logit_grafting = False,
        graft_hidden_states = None,
        layer2graft = None,
    ):
        # ... (existing forward pass code)
        if idx == layer2graft and logit_grafting:
            hidden_states[:,-1,:] = graft_hidden_states
        # ... (rest of the forward pass)
```

This modification allows for the injection of crafted hidden states at a specified layer, simulating the effect of jailbreak techniques.

### 4.2 Top-K Intermediate Consistency

The Top-K Intermediate Consistency metric is implemented in the `topk_intermediate_confidence_heatmap` function in `visualization.py`:

```python
def topk_intermediate_confidence_heatmap(forward_info, topk=5, layer_nums=32, left=0, right=33, model_name="", dataset_size=100):
    # ... (code for calculating and visualizing Top-K Intermediate Consistency)
```

This function analyzes the consistency of the model's predictions across different layers and visualizes the results as a heatmap.

# Potential Enhancements

1. **Multi-language Support**: Extend the analysis to support multiple languages by incorporating multilingual models and datasets. This would help validate the findings across different linguistic and cultural contexts.

2. **Dynamic Jailbreak Detection**: Develop a real-time system that uses the WSE method to detect potential jailbreak attempts during model inference. This could involve monitoring the intermediate hidden states for unusual patterns or deviations from expected ethical associations.

3. **Adaptive Alignment Techniques**: Based on the insights gained from the WSE method, design new alignment techniques that dynamically adjust the model's behavior during training or fine-tuning. This could involve reinforcing the association between ethical concepts and appropriate emotional responses in the middle layers.

4. **Explainable AI Integration**: Integrate the WSE method with other explainable AI techniques to provide a more comprehensive understanding of LLM decision-making. This could include combining the analysis of intermediate hidden states with attention visualization or concept activation vectors.

5. **Adversarial Training Framework**: Develop an adversarial training framework that uses the insights from the WSE method to generate more effective training examples. This framework could automatically identify weaknesses in the model's ethical reasoning and generate targeted examples to improve its performance.
