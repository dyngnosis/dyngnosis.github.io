**Title:** RePD: Defending Jailbreak Attack through a Retrieval-based Prompt Decomposition Process
**Authors:** Peiran Wang, Xiaogeng Liu, Chaowei Xiao
**Affiliation:** University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison
**Publication Date:** October 11, 2024

Summary:
This paper introduces RePD, a novel defense framework against jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). RePD uses a retrieval-based prompt decomposition strategy to identify and neutralize potentially harmful elements in user prompts before processing them.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of RePD, a retrieval-based prompt decomposition framework for defending against jailbreak attacks
- Implementation of a one-shot learning paradigm using a database of pre-collected jailbreak prompt templates
- Demonstration of RePD's effectiveness in enhancing LLM resilience against jailbreak attacks without compromising performance on benign prompts

Problem Statement:
Despite extensive pre-training and fine-tuning for ethical alignment, LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that can bypass safety protocols and induce harmful outputs.

Methodology:
1. Retrieval Process:
   - Maintains a database of known jailbreak attack templates
   - Searches for the most similar template to the input prompt
2. Prompt Decomposition:
   - Uses the retrieved template to teach the LLM how to decompose the input prompt
   - Separates the potential jailbreak elements from the user's intended query
3. One-shot Learning:
   - Incorporates the decomposition process as a learning example for the LLM
4. Response Generation:
   - LLM first neutralizes potentially harmful elements
   - Processes the user's intended query in alignment with ethical guidelines

Results and Findings:
- RePD reduced the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 87.2% compared to existing methods
- Maintained a low false positive rate of 8.2% on safe content
- Outperformed other defense schemes in terms of ASR, False Positive Rate (FPR), and accuracy
- Demonstrated effectiveness against various types of jailbreak attacks, including adaptive, encoding, and embedding attacks

Qualitative Analysis:
- RePD's success lies in its ability to teach LLMs to recognize and separate malicious components from user queries
- The retrieval-based approach allows for adaptability to new jailbreak techniques as they emerge
- The framework's versatility enables its use with various open-source LLMs

Limitations:
- Introduces additional time costs due to extended token length
- Primarily focused on template-based jailbreak attacks
- May require regular updates to the jailbreak template database to remain effective against new attack patterns

Conclusion and Future Work:
RePD demonstrates significant improvement in defending against jailbreak attacks while maintaining LLM performance on benign queries. Future work may focus on:
- Reducing computational overhead
- Expanding defense capabilities against non-template-based attacks
- Developing more efficient template retrieval and updating mechanisms

Tools Introduced:
