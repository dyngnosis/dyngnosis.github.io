**Title:** Is the System Message Really Important for Jailbreaks in Large Language Models?
**Authors:** Anonymous ACL submission
**Publication Date:** February 20, 2024 (preprint)

Abstract Summary:
This paper investigates the importance of system messages in preventing jailbreaks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors conduct experiments with varying system messages (short, long, and none) to assess their impact on jailbreak resistance. They propose a System Messages Evolutionary Algorithm (SMEA) to generate more robust system messages against jailbreak attempts.

Key Contributions:
- Comprehensive analysis of system messages' role in LLM security
- Exploration of jailbreak prompt transferability across LLMs with different system messages
- Development of SMEA to optimize system messages for enhanced jailbreak resistance
- Demonstration of improved LLM robustness through minor changes in system messages

Problem Statement:
The research aims to determine the significance of system messages in preventing jailbreaks in LLMs and to develop methods for optimizing these messages to enhance security.

Methodology:
1. Experimental Setup:
   - LLMs tested: GPT3.5-turbo-0613, LLAMA2 (7b, 7b-chat, 13b, 13b-chat), VICUNA (7b, 13b)
   - System message variations: short, long, and none
   - Dataset: 300 jailbreak prompts generated using GPTFuzzer

2. Evaluation Metric:
   - Attack Success Rate (ASR) to measure jailbreak effectiveness

3. System Messages Evolutionary Algorithm (SMEA):
   - Initialization: Generate similar sentences from initial seed
   - Generation: Create new individuals using rephrase, crossover, or mixed methods
   - Evaluation: Assess ASR for each system message
   - Selection: Choose individuals with lowest fitness values for next iteration

Main Results:
1. System messages significantly impact jailbreak resistance in most LLMs tested.
2. LLMs with long system messages generally exhibit lower overall ASR.
3. Jailbreak prompts show some transferability between different system message configurations.
4. SMEA effectively generates diverse and robust system messages, improving jailbreak resistance.

Qualitative Analysis:
- The study highlights the often-overlooked importance of system messages in LLM security.
- Minor changes in system messages can lead to significant improvements in jailbreak resistance.
- The effectiveness of SMEA demonstrates the potential for evolutionary algorithms in enhancing LLM security.

Limitations:
- Limited number of iterations and population size in SMEA experiments due to computational constraints.
- Potential for SMEA to get trapped in local optima during optimization.
- Results may not generalize to all LLM architectures or future models.

Conclusion and Future Work:
The research demonstrates the crucial role of system messages in LLM security and provides a novel approach (SMEA) for optimizing these messages. Future work could focus on:
1. Exploring diverse population initialization strategies for SMEA
2. Optimizing prompts to enhance SMEA performance
3. Investigating the effectiveness of SMEA on a broader range of LLM architectures and sizes
