**Title:** Unleashing Worms and Extracting Data: Escalating the Outcome of Attacks against RAG-based Inference in Scale and Severity Using Jailbreaking

**Authors:** Stav Cohen, Ron Bitton, Ben Nassi

**Publication Date:** September 12, 2024

Summary:
This paper demonstrates how jailbreaking GenAI models can escalate attacks against RAG-based GenAI applications in severity and scale. It presents two main attack vectors: RAG documents extraction attacks and a worm targeting GenAI ecosystems.

Key Contributions:
- Demonstration of RAG documents extraction attack, extracting 80%-99.8% of database content
- Introduction of a worm concept for GenAI ecosystems using adversarial self-replicating prompts
- Evaluation of attack performance across various embeddings algorithms, context sizes, and GenAI engines
- Analysis of guardrails for protecting RAG-based inference

Problem Statement:
The research addresses the security risks posed by jailbroken GenAI models in RAG-based applications, focusing on escalating existing attacks in severity and scale.

Methodology:
1. RAG Documents Extraction Attack:
   - Implemented a medical Q&A chatbot using LangChain and VectorStores
   - Used ChatDoctor-100k dataset for evaluation
   - Compared three extraction methods: Random Draw, English Distribution, and Adaptive/Dynamic
   - Evaluated influence of embeddings algorithms, context size, and GenAI engines

2. RAG-based Worm:
   - Implemented GenAI-powered email assistants using LangChain
   - Used Enron dataset for evaluation
   - Crafted adversarial self-replicating prompts for worm propagation
   - Evaluated worm performance across various factors (context size, embeddings, GenAI engines)

Main Results:
1. RAG Documents Extraction Attack:
   - Adaptive Method extracted 80.6% of documents from the database
   - Extraction rates highly affected by context size (k) and embeddings algorithm
   - Significant differences in extraction rates between GenAI engines

2. RAG-based Worm:
   - Combined success rate of ~20% for worm propagation via email generation/enrichment
   - Worm maintained >90% replication & payload success rate for up to 11 hops
   - GenAI engine significantly affects worm resilience

Qualitative Analysis:
- The research demonstrates the potential for escalating existing RAG-based attacks using jailbroken GenAI models
- The worm concept introduces a new threat vector for GenAI ecosystems, highlighting the need for improved security measures
- The effectiveness of attacks varies significantly based on factors like embeddings algorithms and GenAI engines, suggesting potential areas for defensive focus

Limitations:
- Experiments conducted in lab environment, not tested on real-world applications
- Reliance on jailbreaking success, which may become more difficult as GenAI models are patched
- Potential for detection of adversarial self-replicating prompts by human reviewers or classifiers

Conclusion and Future Work:
- The paper highlights the need for improved security measures in RAG-based GenAI applications
- Proposed guardrails include access control, API throttling, thresholding, and data sanitization
- Future work may focus on developing more robust defenses against jailbreaking and adaptive attacks
