Summary:
This paper introduces the RoleBreak framework, which systematically analyzes character hallucination in role-playing systems powered by large language models (LLMs). The authors identify query sparsity and role-query conflict as key factors driving character hallucination and propose a novel defense strategy called Narrator Mode to mitigate these issues.

Key Contributions:
- Introduction of the RoleBreak framework for analyzing character hallucination
- Development of the RoleBreakEval dataset for evaluating hallucination mitigation techniques
- Proposal of the Narrator Mode as a defense strategy against character hallucination

Problem Statement:
Role-playing systems using LLMs are susceptible to character hallucinations, where the model generates responses inconsistent with the intended persona. Existing mitigation techniques rely on rejection-based strategies, which limit generalization and creative storytelling.

Methodology:
1. RoleBreak Framework:
   - Identifies query sparsity and role-query conflict as core mechanisms of character hallucination
   - Constructs attack queries based on these principles

2. RoleBreakEval Dataset:
   - Semi-automated construction of attack queries
   - 50 anonymized English roles and 1,013 corresponding queries

3. Evaluation Metrics:
   - Hallucination Rate (HR)
   - Role Fidelity (RF)
   - Query Fidelity (QF)
   - Story Coherence (SC)

4. Narrator Mode:
   - Generates supplemental narrative context
   - Includes Global Outline, Local Plot, and Target Verification components

Main Results:
1. RoleBreak effectively detects vulnerabilities in existing models:
   - Both closed-source and open-source models show poor defense capabilities
   - Models with rejection strategies reduce hallucinations but perform poorly in role and query fidelity

2. Narrator Mode outperforms traditional refusal-based strategies:
   - Reduces hallucinations
   - Enhances fidelity to character roles and queries
   - Improves overall narrative coherence

Qualitative Analysis:
- The paper highlights the limitations of rejection-based strategies in handling creative storytelling and maintaining user immersion
- Narrator Mode demonstrates the potential for balancing role fidelity with adaptability in custom story development

Limitations:
- The dataset primarily consists of English-language characters, potentially limiting generalizability to other languages and cultural contexts
- The study does not cover all possible types and sizes of LLMs due to resource constraints

Conclusion and Future Work:
The RoleBreak framework provides a comprehensive analysis of character hallucination in role-playing systems. The proposed Narrator Mode shows promise in addressing the limitations of existing mitigation techniques. Future research may explore more advanced character management techniques and dynamic narrative generation mechanisms to enhance model robustness in diverse role-playing scenarios.
