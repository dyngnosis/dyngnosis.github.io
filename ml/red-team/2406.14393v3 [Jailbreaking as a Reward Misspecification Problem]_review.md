## Overview

**Title:** Jailbreaking as a Reward Misspecification Problem
**Authors:** Zhihui Xie, Jiahui Gao, Lei Li, Zhenguo Li, Qi Liu, Lingpeng Kong
**Affiliations:** The University of Hong Kong, Huawei Noah's Ark Lab
**Publication Date:** June 20, 2024

Brief Summary: This paper proposes a novel perspective on the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks, attributing it to reward misspecification during the alignment process. The authors introduce a metric called ReGap to quantify reward misspecification and present ReMiss, a system for automated red teaming that generates adversarial prompts in a reward-misspecified space.

## Key Contributions

1. Introduction of ReGap metric to quantify reward misspecification
2. Development of ReMiss, an automated red teaming system for generating adversarial prompts
3. Demonstration of state-of-the-art attack success rates on the AdvBench benchmark
4. Analysis of transferability to closed-source models and out-of-distribution tasks

## Problem Statement

The paper addresses the vulnerability of safety-aligned LLMs to adversarial attacks, specifically jailbreaking attempts. The authors argue that this vulnerability stems from reward misspecification during the alignment process, where the reward function fails to accurately capture intended behavior.

## Methodology

1. Introduction of ReGap metric:
   - Measures the difference between implicit rewards on harmless and harmful responses
   - Used to quantify the extent of reward misspecification

2. Development of ReMiss system:
   - Generates adversarial suffixes based on a given prompt using LLMs
   - Employs a training pipeline to learn a generator model that maps prompts to adversarial suffixes
   - Utilizes stochastic beam search to explore suffixes in a reward-misspecified space

3. Evaluation:
   - Tested on various open-source and closed-source LLMs
   - Used AdvBench dataset for training and testing
   - Evaluated transferability to closed-source models and out-of-distribution tasks using HarmBench

## Main Results and Findings

1. ReMiss achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on the AdvBench benchmark
2. Generated adversarial prompts maintain human readability
3. High transferability of attacks to closed-source models like GPT-4o
4. Effectiveness in jailbreaking models with strong guardrails (e.g., Llama2-7b-chat)
5. Superior performance compared to baseline methods across various evaluators (keyword matching, LlamaGuard, GPT-4)

## Qualitative Analysis

1. ReGap serves as a better proxy for jailbreaking compared to target loss
2. ReMiss automatically discovers various attack modes, including translation, continuation, in-context examples, and infilling
3. The approach effectively finds reward-misspecified prompts across different target models
4. ReMiss demonstrates the ability to generate diverse and effective adversarial suffixes

## Limitations and Considerations

1. Assumes access to a white-box reference model and the log probability of responses from the target model
2. Effectiveness may vary depending on the strength of the target model's alignment and safety measures

## Conclusion and Future Work

The paper concludes that viewing language model alignment through the lens of reward misspecification offers a practical approach for enhancing LLM safety and reliability. Future work could focus on:

1. Developing more robust alignment techniques that address reward misspecification
2. Exploring defensive measures against reward misspecification-based attacks
3. Investigating the applicability of this approach to other types of machine learning models

## Tutorial and Enhancement Suggestions

# ReMiss: Jailbreaking as a Reward Misspecification Problem

## Tutorial

### 1. Project Overview

The ReMiss project implements a novel approach to generating adversarial prompts for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). The core idea is to view jailbreaking as a reward misspecification problem, where the LLM's training process fails to properly align the model's behavior with intended goals.

Key components of the project include:
- Implementation of the ReMiss algorithm
- Evaluation scripts for testing jailbreak effectiveness
- Utility functions for working with LLMs and sequences

### 3. Key Components

#### 3.1 src/sequence.py

This file defines the core data structures for working with sequences of tokens:

- `Seq`: Represents a sequence of tokens with various representations (ids, logits, probs, text)
- `MergedSeq`: Allows concatenation of multiple `Seq` objects
- `EmptySeq`: Represents an empty sequence

These classes provide a flexible way to manipulate and convert between different sequence representations, which is crucial for working with LLM inputs and outputs.

#### 3.2 src/utils.py

Contains various utility functions, including:

- `llm_loader`: Loads pretrained language models
- `get_dataloader`: Creates DataLoader objects for training and evaluation
- `check_jailbroken`: Checks if a generated response bypasses safety measures
- `evaluate_prompt_gpt`: Evaluates prompts using OpenAI's GPT models

#### 3.3 src/advprompteropt.py

Implements the AdvPrompter optimization algorithm, which is an alternative to ReMiss. Key functions include:

- `advPrompterOpt`: Main optimization loop
- `get_next_token_probabilities`: Computes probabilities for the next token
- `select_and_evaluate_next_token_candidates`: Selects and evaluates candidate tokens
- `select_next_beams`: Performs beam search to select the best candidates

#### 3.4 src/remissopt.py

Contains the implementation of the ReMiss algorithm:

- `reMissOpt`: Main optimization function for ReMiss
- `calculate_reward`: Computes the reward gap between harmless and harmful responses

#### 3.5 src/llm.py

Defines the `LLM` class, which wraps pretrained language models and provides methods for:

- Generating responses
- Computing losses
- Performing teacher-forced prediction

#### 3.6 main.py

The main entry point for training and evaluation. It defines the `Workspace` class, which orchestrates the entire process:

- Loading models and data
- Training the generator model
- Evaluating jailbreak effectiveness

### 4. Key Algorithms and Techniques

#### 4.1 ReMiss Algorithm

The core of the project is the ReMiss algorithm, implemented in `src/remissopt.py`. The key steps are:

1. Compute initial losses for prompts without suffixes
2. Initialize beam scores and suffix beams
3. Iteratively generate and evaluate candidate suffixes:
   a. Get next token probabilities
   b. Select and evaluate next token candidates
   c. Update beam scores and select best candidates
4. Return the optimized suffix

The algorithm uses a novel reward function that measures the gap between harmless and harmful responses, as defined in the `calculate_reward` function.

#### 4.2 Beam Search

Both ReMiss and AdvPrompter use beam search to explore the space of possible suffixes. This is implemented in the `select_next_beams` function, which maintains a set of top-k candidates at each step.

#### 4.3 Teacher Forcing

The `LLM` class uses teacher forcing for efficient loss computation and generation. This technique feeds the ground truth tokens during training, allowing for parallel computation of losses for the entire sequence.

### 5. Evaluation

The project includes several evaluation scripts:

- `eval_search.py`: Performs a search over different hyperparameters
- `eval_llamaguard.py`: Evaluates generated prompts using the LlamaGuard model
- `eval_transfergpt.py`: Tests transferability of jailbreaks to GPT models

These scripts help assess the effectiveness of the generated jailbreaks across different models and evaluation criteria.

3. **Incorporation of Human Feedback**
   - Current implementation: Relies solely on automated evaluation
   - Enhancement: Integrate a human-in-the-loop component for evaluating jailbreak quality
   - Potential impact: Generate more natural and less detectable jailbreaks

4. **Dynamic Suffix Length**
   - Current implementation: Fixed maximum suffix length
   - Enhancement: Implement a dynamic suffix length that adapts based on the prompt and optimization progress
   - Potential impact: More efficient optimization and potentially more effective jailbreaks

5. **Adversarial Training for Robustness**
   - Current implementation: Focuses on generating jailbreaks
   - Enhancement: Develop an adversarial training pipeline that uses generated jailbreaks to improve model robustness
   - Potential impact: Contribute to the development of more secure language models

These enhancements address limitations mentioned in the paper and extend the functionality of the ReMiss system to push the research forward in areas such as robustness, transferability, and practical applicability.
