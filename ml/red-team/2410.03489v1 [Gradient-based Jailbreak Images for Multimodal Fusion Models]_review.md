Key Contributions:
- Introduction of tokenizer shortcuts to enable continuous optimization in multimodal fusion models
- First end-to-end gradient image attacks against multimodal fusion models
- Demonstration of jailbreak images outperforming text jailbreaks in effectiveness and efficiency
- Analysis of jailbreak image transferability and effectiveness against white-box protections

Problem Statement:
How to create effective jailbreak attacks on multimodal fusion models that tokenize all input modalities, including images, using non-differentiable functions?

Methodology:
1. Developed tokenizer shortcuts:
   - Embedding shortcut: Maps VQ-VAE embeddings to LLM embedding space
   - 1-hot shortcut: Maps VQ-VAE embeddings to soft one-hot encoding over tokens
2. Optimized jailbreak images using gradient descent
3. Evaluated attacks on Chameleon models using JailbreakBench dataset
4. Compared performance with text-based attacks (GCG) and representation engineering methods

Main Results:
1. Jailbreak images successful for 72.5% of prompts
2. Outperformed text-based attacks (GCG: 63.8%)
3. Required 3x less compute than GCG
4. Jailbreak images do not increase average token perplexity
5. Limited transferability across models

Qualitative Analysis:
- Jailbreak images offer a larger attack surface (1024 image tokens vs. 20 text tokens)
- Embedding shortcuts provide more flexible representation to circumvent protections
- Jailbreak images are harder to detect using perplexity-based methods

Limitations:
- Attack success varies with hyperparameter choices
- Limited transferability across models
- Evaluation conducted only on Chameleon models due to lack of open-source alternatives

Conclusion and Future Work:
- Tokenizer shortcuts enable effective jailbreak attacks on multimodal fusion models
- Future research should focus on improving transferability and exploring more flexible target functions
- Encourage evaluation on future multimodal architectures as they become available
