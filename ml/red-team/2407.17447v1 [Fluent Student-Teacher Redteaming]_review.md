**Title:** Fluent Student-Teacher Redteaming
**Authors:** T. Ben Thompson, Michael Sklar
**Affiliation:** Confirm Labs
**Publication Date:** July 2024

Summary:
This paper presents improved techniques for generating fluent adversarial attacks on safety-tuned language models like Llama-2 and Phi-3. The authors develop a distillation-based approach that encourages victim models to emulate toxified versions, along with multi-model perplexity penalties to increase human-fluency of attacks. Their method achieves high attack success rates while maintaining low perplexity.

Key Contributions:
- New distillation-based objective function for adversarial attacks
- Multi-model perplexity penalty and repetition penalty to increase human-fluency  
- Enhanced optimization allowing token insertions, swaps, and deletions
- Demonstration of high attack success rates (>93%) on models like Llama-2 while maintaining low perplexity
- Universal fluent prompt with high transfer to unseen tasks and models

Problem Statement:
Existing adversarial attack methods for language models often produce gibberish text that is easily filtered and may fail on well-tuned models. The challenge is to generate human-fluent attacks that can reliably jailbreak safety-tuned models.

Methodology:
1. Develop distillation-based objective function using toxified model copies
2. Implement multi-model perplexity penalty and repetition penalty 
3. Enhance optimization with token insertions, swaps, and deletions
4. Evaluate on models like Llama-2, Llama-3, Vicuna, and Phi-3
5. Test universal prompt on unseen tasks and transfer to other models

Main Results:
- >93% attack success rates on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Vicuna-7B with perplexity <33
- 95% attack success on Phi-3 (higher perplexity)  
- Universal prompt achieves >88% compliance on unseen tasks across multiple models

Qualitative Analysis:
- The distillation approach allows more generalizable attacks compared to token forcing
- Multi-model perplexity penalties produce more human-fluent attacks
- Longer prompts and flexible optimization improve attack strength
- Universal prompts show potential for transfer across tasks and models

Limitations:
- Higher computational cost compared to some existing methods
- Some models like Phi-3 still result in higher perplexity attacks
- Potential for misuse in generating harmful content

Conclusion:
The paper demonstrates significant improvements in generating fluent adversarial attacks on safety-tuned language models. The techniques allow for reliable jailbreaking of difficult models while maintaining human-like fluency. This work has implications for both improving and evaluating the robustness of language model safety measures.

Future Work:
- Reducing computational expenses of the method
- Improving proxy objectives for human-fluency 
- Extending to very long token sequences (>10,000 tokens)
- Exploring defenses against these types of attacks

## Tutorial and Enhancement Suggestions

# FLRT: Fluent Language Model Redteaming Tutorial

## 1. Project Overview

FLRT (Fluent Language Model Redteaming) is a Python-based framework for generating fluent adversarial attacks on safety-tuned language models. The project implements the techniques described in the paper "Fluent Student-Teacher Redteaming" to create human-like prompts that can jailbreak language models while maintaining low perplexity.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions
- `flrt/`: Main package containing the core functionality
  - `attack.py`: Implementation of the attack algorithm
  - `objective.py`: Defines objective functions for optimization
  - `operators.py`: Implements token manipulation operations
  - `victim.py`: Manages attack victims (target models)
  - `judge.py`: Evaluates attack success and fluency
  - `templates.py`: Defines prompt templates
  - `util.py`: Utility functions for model loading and generation
  - `finetune.py`: Fine-tuning script for creating toxified models
  - `translate.py`: Translates attack prompts to different languages
  - `internal.py`: Internal objective functions (experimental)
  - `modal_defs.py` and `modal_download.py`: Scripts for distributed computing using Modal

## 2. Key Components and Functionality

### 2.1 Attack Algorithm (`attack.py`)

The `attack` function in `attack.py` is the main entry point for generating adversarial prompts. It uses an iterative optimization process to refine the attack prompt:

1. Initialize a random prompt or load a checkpoint
2. Evaluate the prompt using objective functions
3. Apply token manipulation operators (insert, delete, swap)
4. Update the prompt based on the best candidates
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a specified number of iterations

Key classes:
- `AttackConfig`: Configures attack parameters
- `Settings`: Defines hyperparameters for each optimization phase

### 2.2 Objective Functions (`objective.py`)

The `Objective` class defines the optimization targets:

- `attack_mult`: Encourages the model to generate specified content
- `fluency_mult`: Penalizes low-probability token sequences
- `repetition_mult`: Discourages repetitive text

The `InternalObjective` class (in `internal.py`) implements the distillation-based objective, comparing internal model representations between the base and toxified models.

### 2.3 Token Operators (`operators.py`)

Implements token-level manipulations:
- `delete`: Removes tokens from the prompt
- `insert`: Adds new tokens to the prompt
- `swap`: Exchanges tokens in the prompt

### 2.4 Victim Models (`victim.py`)

The `Victim` class manages the target language models:
- Loads pre-trained models and tokenizers
- Handles both base and fine-tuned (toxified) models
- Defines banned tokens to avoid in the attack

### 2.5 Evaluation (`judge.py`)

The `judge` function evaluates attack success and fluency:
- Uses OpenAI's API to assess task completion
- Calculates perplexity and repetition scores
- Identifies successful attacks that maintain low perplexity

### 2.6 Prompt Templates (`templates.py`)

Defines various prompt structures for different attack scenarios:
- `default_template`: Standard two-part prompt
- `multi_template`: Multi-turn conversation prompt
- `injection_template`: Includes specific text injection

### 2.7 Utility Functions (`util.py`)

Provides helper functions for:
- Loading models and tokenizers
- Text generation
- Managing model configurations

## 3. Relation to Research Concepts

The code implements several key concepts from the paper:

1. **Distillation-based Objective**: The `InternalObjective` class compares internal representations between base and toxified models, implementing the student-teacher distillation approach.

2. **Multi-model Perplexity Penalty**: The `fluency_mult` parameter in the `Objective` class encourages human-like fluency across multiple models.

3. **Repetition Penalty**: Implemented via the `repetition_mult` parameter to discourage repetitive text.

4. **Enhanced Optimization**: The `operators.py` module allows for flexible token manipulations, including insertions, deletions, and swaps.

5. **Universal Prompt Generation**: The attack algorithm can generate prompts that transfer across tasks and models by optimizing for multiple objectives simultaneously.

## 4. Notable Algorithms and Techniques

### 4.1 Gradient-based Candidate Generation

The `gcg_candidates` method in `Objective` uses gradient information to propose token replacements, implementing a version of the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm.

### 4.2 BEAST-inspired Candidate Selection

The `beast_candidates` method samples replacement tokens based on their probability under the model, inspired by the BEAST algorithm for adversarial attacks.

### 4.3 Prefix Evaluation Optimization

The `prefix_evaluate` method in `Objective` optimizes evaluation for prompts with shared prefixes, reducing computational overhead.

### 4.4 Adaptive Token Length

The attack algorithm can dynamically adjust the token length of the prompt during optimization using the `token_length_ramp` parameter.
