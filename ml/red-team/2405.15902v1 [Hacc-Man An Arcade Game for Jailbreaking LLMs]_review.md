**Title:** Hacc-Man: An Arcade Game for Jailbreaking LLMs

Summary:
This paper introduces Hacc-Man, an arcade game designed to challenge players to "jailbreak" Large Language Models (LLMs). The game aims to raise awareness about LLM security risks, increase user self-efficacy in LLM interactions, and explore creative problem-solving strategies in LLM jailbreaking.

Key Contributions:
- Development of Hacc-Man, an interactive game for LLM jailbreaking
- Raising awareness about LLM security risks and jailbreaking techniques
- Increasing user self-efficacy in LLM interactions
- Exploring and categorizing creative problem-solving strategies in LLM jailbreaking

Problem Statement:
The paper addresses the security and safety threats posed by the widespread use of LLMs, particularly the potential for users to "break into" systems running LLMs through creative use of language.

Methodology:
- Creation of an arcade-style game with multiple jailbreaking challenges
- Use of different LLMs (GPT 3.5, GPT 4.0, Google Gemma 1.1) for various challenges
- Collection of user demographic data and jailbreaking attempts
- Automatic evaluation of successful jailbreaks using predefined "solutions"

Main Results and Findings:
- The game offers six different jailbreaking challenges, each mimicking different classes of LLM guardrails
- Challenges include making LLMs produce curse words, misinformation, and leak sensitive data
- The game allows for the creation of a database of creative problem-solving strategies in LLM jailbreaking

Qualitative Analysis:
- The game positions itself at the intersection of LLM security and creativity research
- Jailbreaking is proposed as a new form of creative problem-solving with high ecological validity
- The game may contribute to increasing users' self-efficacy in LLM interactions by changing the power dynamic

Limitations:
- The effectiveness of the game in raising awareness and increasing self-efficacy is not yet empirically validated
- The study does not provide detailed analysis of the collected jailbreaking strategies

Conclusion and Future Work:
- The authors plan to make their dataset publicly available for further research
- The game is expected to contribute to both LLM security and creativity research fields
- Future work may involve analyzing the collected jailbreaking strategies and their evolution over time

Tools Introduced:
- Hacc-Man: An arcade-style game for LLM jailbreaking (available at www.hacc-man.com)
- No GitHub repository mentioned
